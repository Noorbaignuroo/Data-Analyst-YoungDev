# GitHub Repository: Data Science Projects

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains a collection of data science projects focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and deep learning for image classification and natural language processing (NLP). Each project includes detailed code implementations and explanations.

## Projects

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Description:**
  Conduct in-depth EDA on various datasets, addressing missing values, outliers, and data anomalies. Utilize visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships.

- **Files:**
  - `EDA.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing EDA code.
  - `data/`: Directory containing datasets used for analysis.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Description:**
  Perform essential data cleaning tasks, including standardizing column names, encoding categorical variables, and transforming numerical data. Merge or join multiple datasets based on common columns to create a unified dataset.

- **Files:**
  - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing code.
  - `cleaned_data.csv`: Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.

### 3. Deep Learning for Image Classification

- **Description:**
  Build and fine-tune convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. Utilize frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Explore advanced architectures such as transfer learning with pre-trained models and conduct hyperparameter tuning.

- **Files:**
  - `Image_Classification_TF.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for image classification using TensorFlow.
  - `Image_Classification_PyTorch.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for image classification using PyTorch.

### 4. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects

- **Description:**
  Develop advanced NLP models for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, or language generation. Work with transformer-based models like BERT or GPT-3.

- **Files:**
  - `NLP_Projects.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with NLP project implementations.
  - `data/`: Directory containing NLP datasets used for modeling.
